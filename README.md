This project aims to analyze and predict student performance based on various socio-economic and personal factors. It is built as a complete end-to-end Machine Learning pipeline, including data ingestion, EDA, model training, evaluation, CI/CD, and cloud deployment on AWS & Azure.

# Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to understand how a student's academic performance (exam/test scores) is influenced by factors such as:

Gender

Ethnicity

Parental level of education

Lunch type

Test preparation course

Using this data, we build a predictive ML model that estimates student test scores.
